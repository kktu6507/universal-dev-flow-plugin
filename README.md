# udflow - Universal Dev Flow (Claude Code plugin)

[![Validate](https://github.com/kktu6507/universal-dev-flow-plugin/actions/workflows/validate.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kktu6507/universal-dev-flow-plugin/actions/workflows/validate.yml)

**English** · [繁體中文](README.zh-TW.md) · [日本語](README.ja.md)

**udflow makes Claude Code behave like a cautious release engineer:** plan first, change only after approval, verify with evidence, then decide `READY` / `FIX REQUIRED` / `NOT READY`.

udflow covers development through production with two flows. The **dev flow** is a plan-gated code-review and release-readiness workflow: plan → approve → implement → verify → risk-selected review → verdict. The **incident flow** is that flow inverted for live production emergencies: mitigate first, diagnose second, hand the formal fix back to the dev flow, then close with a postmortem. udflow is not a bug scanner, linter, static analyzer, CI replacement, or zero-bug guarantee. Its job is to make AI-made changes traceable: stated intent, acceptance criteria, smallest safe implementation, real verification evidence, risk-selected review, and a gatekeeper verdict.

```text
Dev flow       Task -> Understand -> Plan (no code yet) -> YOU APPROVE plan + acceptance criteria
                    -> smallest safe change -> build / test / lint / browser evidence
                    -> risk-selected reviewers -> Gatekeeper verdict
                           READY / FIX REQUIRED / NOT READY -> repair loop when needed

Incident flow  Alert -> Triage -> preserve evidence -> MITIGATE FIRST (reversible, one decision card at a time)
                     -> diagnose -> red repro -> fix via the dev flow above (--lite)
                     -> production re-entry + observation window -> postmortem

Learning loop  incident postmortem -> FAILURE_MEMORY -> the next dev-flow planning reads it
```

## What's inside

Four skills, two of which engage on their own:

| Skill | Purpose | Details |
|---|---|---|
| `universal-dev-flow` | The dev flow. Auto-engages on non-trivial dev work: plan-gated implement → verify → risk-selected review → verdict. Manual start: `/udflow:run`. | [How it works](#how-it-works) |
| `incident-response` | The incident flow. Auto-engages on production-incident language: mitigate first, then hand the fix to the dev flow. Manual: `/udflow:incident-response`, plus a `prepare` mode. | [The incident flow](#the-incident-flow-incident-response) |
| `run` | Manual starter for the dev flow (`/udflow:run <task>`); never auto-engages. | [Quick start](#quick-start) |
| `doctor` | Local health self-check of the hooks + environment (`/udflow:doctor`); no telemetry. | [Quick start](#quick-start) |

The two flows feed each other: an incident's formal fix is handed to the dev flow as a `--lite` run with the incident reproduction as its primary acceptance criterion, and the incident postmortem writes a prevention rule into `FAILURE_MEMORY.md` — which dev-flow planning reads before the next change.

### Project layout

Everything udflow keeps in a consuming project lives under one root folder:

```text
udflowOp/
  memory/     # FAILURE_MEMORY.md — lessons the next plan reads (committed)
  design/     # design.md — the UI design contract (committed)
  ops/        # OPS_PROFILE.md — the incident-response peacetime map (committed)
  incidents/  # INCIDENT-<date>-<slug>.md journals — the audit trail (committed)
  output/     # per-run scratch: contract.md, evidence, review diffs (run scratch — never committed, self-gitignored)
```

Pre-0.42.0 layouts (`ai/FAILURE_MEMORY.md`, a repo-root `design.md`, `output/udflow/`) are auto-migrated one time: the workflow moves each file to its new home, deletes the legacy one, and discloses the move in-run.

## 30-second version

udflow does three things:

| Moment | What udflow adds |
|---|---|
| **Before coding** | Claude restates the requirement, turns it into a plan and acceptance criteria, and waits for approval. |
| **During coding** | `implementer` makes the smallest safe change and does not self-certify. |
| **Before delivery** | Risk-selected reviewers inspect the change against your intent, then `gatekeeper` decides `READY` / `FIX REQUIRED` / `NOT READY`. |

During a production incident, `incident-response` adds the same discipline under fire:

| Moment | What udflow adds |
|---|---|
| **First minutes** | An evidence snapshot (~1 minute, non-skippable), then reversible mitigations — one decision card at a time; you approve or reject, and never have to read code. |
| **After stable** | Diagnose by fault domain, then a red→green reproduction gate before any fix. |
| **The fix** | Handed to the dev flow above — the incident skill never hot-patches production. |
| **After closure** | The postmortem feeds failure memory, so the next dev-flow plan already knows. |

Use udflow when "done" must mean release-ready: merging to `main`, shipping a user-facing change, or touching authentication, data, contracts, migrations, production behavior, or high-risk UI flow.

Skip udflow for typo fixes, pure formatting, very small no-risk edits, or quick looks. Use cheaper deterministic tools first when they fit.

> Live demo: [udflow-public-demo](https://github.com/kktu6507/udflow-public-demo) captures one `/udflow:run` end to end.

## Quick start

Prerequisites: **Claude Code** + `node` on `PATH`. The hooks are Node scripts; with no Node they silently no-op.

```text
# in your project directory, inside Claude Code:
/plugin marketplace add kktu6507/plugins
/plugin install udflow@kktu
# udflow ships DISABLED - enable it: /plugin -> Installed -> toggle udflow on
#   or: claude plugin enable udflow@kktu
/reload-plugins

# hand it a task:
/udflow:run Fix the login flow so expired access tokens are refreshed once before retrying the failed request.

# before you need it: build the incident ops map (where logs live, rollback paths, kill switches)
/udflow:incident-response prepare

# during an incident, plain language is enough — the skill auto-engages on incident language:
production is down — checkout returns 500s since the last deploy
```

- **Install does not enable the plugin.** Until enabled, udflow's hooks and skills do nothing.
- **Marketplace name is `kktu`.** The install id is `udflow@kktu`.
- **Update:** `/plugin marketplace update kktu` (refresh the catalog) → `/plugin update udflow@kktu` → `/reload-plugins`.
- **Health check:** run `/udflow:doctor` when the gate never blocks, hooks seem silent, or Node may be missing.

## Good tasks

udflow works best when the task includes intent, acceptance criteria, must-not-change scope, expected verification, and risk areas.

```text
/udflow:run <change request>

Requirement:
- ...

Acceptance criteria:
- ...

Must not change:
- ...

Verification expected:
- ...

Risk areas:
- auth / data / contract / UI / performance / rollback
```

See [`docs/task-writing-guide.md`](docs/task-writing-guide.md) for bad / better / best examples and task templates for auth, API contracts, UI states, and migrations.

## When to use it

| Use udflow for | Usually skip udflow for |
|---|---|
| auth / authz changes | typos |
| API or schema contract changes | pure formatting |
| DB migration / data-integrity work | trivial local copy edits |
| UI flow, accessibility, or browser-visible states | quick non-release review |
| release-bound work needing stronger evidence | mechanical checks already covered by CI/linter |

## Anti-goals

udflow is not:

- a replacement for CI
- a replacement for linters or static analysis
- a guarantee of zero bugs
- a tool for exhaustive mechanical scanning
- meant for every tiny edit

The incident flow has its own non-goals — it is not:

- a paging or on-call rotation, nor status-page automation
- an SLO management suite or a full RBAC/permission layer
- a DFIR forensics lab (it classifies, contains, and recommends professionals)
- a multi-repo incident commander

Use udflow with:

- unit and integration tests
- linters and formatters
- static analysis and dependency scanners
- human review for high-risk releases
- controlled live-environment evidence when external systems matter

Linters catch mechanical issues. Tests catch known expected behavior. Static analysis catches known vulnerability patterns. udflow judges whether the AI-made change satisfies the stated intent and is ready to ship.

## How it works

One run, phase by phase (the dev flow):

| Phase | What happens |
|---|---|
| **Understand** | Restate the requirement; ask only when ambiguity changes behavior, contracts, destructive operations, security, or UX. |
| **Plan** | Stay read-only, ground the approach in the repo, and produce acceptance criteria. |
| **Approval** | No code changes before you approve the plan and criteria. |
| **Implement** | `implementer` applies the smallest safe change and writes the per-run task contract (`udflowOp/output/contract.md`). |
| **Verify** | Run build / test / lint / typecheck / browser evidence as applicable; command exit status is authority. |
| **Review** | Only risk-relevant reviewers run, using a focused Review Packet instead of full thread history. |
| **Gatekeeper** | Aggregate findings, re-rate by impact, check each acceptance criterion, and decide `READY` / `FIX REQUIRED` / `NOT READY`. |

Verdicts are release-readiness decisions, not absolute truths. See [`docs/how-to-read-verdicts.md`](docs/how-to-read-verdicts.md).

## The incident flow (incident-response)

Production is broken and the person at the keyboard did not write the code — the normal case for AI-written systems. `incident-response` is the dev flow inverted: **mitigate first, diagnose second, formal fix last.** It engages automatically on incident language ("production is down", "users are blocked") or manually via `/udflow:incident-response`. Every human interaction is a decision card; running an incident never requires you to read code.

| Stage | What happens |
|---|---|
| **1 · Triage** | Evidence-driven, not an interview: run health/error checks to establish severity (SEV1–3), blast radius, whether data is actively corrupting, and one explicit "could this be an intrusion?" check. |
| **2 · Preserve evidence** | The ~1-minute snapshot (logs, timestamps, running version) *before* anything restarts — non-skippable, even under pressure. |
| **3 · Mitigate (loop)** | Reversible, no-new-code actions — rollback (after a migration-compatibility pre-check), feature-flag off, degrade, scale, maintenance mode — one at a time, each verified before the next. Hot-patching unreviewed code into production is named as the classic second disaster and refused. |
| **4 · Diagnose** | Fault-domain classification first: code, config/environment, infrastructure, external dependency, or data. Only code and data continue to a reproduction; the others get direct remediation plus a declared fixed-check. |
| **5 · Reproduce** | A red reproduction — the failing output recorded in the journal — before any fix. An always-green check proves nothing. |
| **6 · Fix** | Handed to the dev flow: a `universal-dev-flow --lite` run with "the incident repro turns green" as the primary acceptance criterion. `--lite` still keeps a directly-relevant safety reviewer on genuine high-risk signals — incident fixes usually carry them. |
| **— Data repair** *(when corruption occurred)* | The code fix stops new corruption; it does not repair the damage. Corruption window → affected-record counts → repair script proven red→green on an extracted copy → human-approved production run. |
| **— Production re-entry** | Deploy through the normal path, verify the declared fixed-check, hold an observation window, then restore mitigations one at a time. |
| **7 · Closure + postmortem** | A closure checklist (mitigations restored, data repaired, extracted data deleted, journal closed) plus a short, blame-free postmortem. |

**Prepare before you need it.** `/udflow:incident-response prepare` builds `udflowOp/ops/OPS_PROFILE.md` — the peacetime map that makes wartime start at 30 seconds instead of 30 minutes: an access inventory marked agent-runnable vs human-only, rollback steps with schema-migration compatibility intel, feature flags, backups, and observability. Every entry carries a trust marker — `verified: <date>`, `dry-run-verified: <date>`, or `UNVERIFIED` — and an unverified rollback command is flagged on the decision card that relies on it, never silently trusted. Prepare mode reports gaps honestly ("no backups found — a restore is impossible today").

**Decision cards.** One at a time: the recommendation, cost/tradeoff, reversibility, and exactly what will run on approval. Destructive or production-affecting actions always stop at a card — never batched into a previously approved plan. The `destructive-guard.js` hook will additionally ask before narrowly destructive commands; that is expected, never routed around.

**Incident journal.** Every stage appends to `udflowOp/incidents/INCIDENT-<date>-<slug>.md` — a committed audit trail (timeline, actions with who approved each, evidence, the red→green record). Sanitize-before-write: PII and secrets are masked before anything enters the journal.

**Production-data safety gate.** When a reproduction needs real data: minimal extraction (only the implicated records, never a dump), PII/secrets masked *before* the data enters the AI context, a synthetic-data fallback when policy forbids production data, and extracted data is ephemeral — never committed, deleted at closure.

**The learning loop.** The postmortem includes a gate-gap analysis — *which dev-flow gate should have caught this before ship?* — answered with a concrete prevention rule and proposed as a failure-memory entry, which dev-flow planning reads before the next change.

Non-goals, briefly: no paging/on-call, no status-page automation, no SLO suite, no full RBAC, no DFIR-grade forensics, no multi-repo incident command (see [Anti-goals](#anti-goals)). The full stage contracts live in the skill's references (`udflow/skills/incident-response/references/`): `wartime.md`, `repro-and-fix.md`, `closure.md`, `ops-profile.md`.

## The 10 subagents

You do not select reviewers manually; udflow assembles the panel by **risk** — a typo engages none, an authentication change engages the security reviewer. The full roster:

| Agent | Role | When it's added | Model |
|---|---|---|---|
| `planner-creator` | grounds the plan in real code, drafts the approach, pre-selects the panel, detects/recommends `design.md` (bootstrap from an existing UI) (read-only; feeds plan approval, never replaces it) | high-risk / correctness-critical planning | inherit |
| `implementer` | smallest safe change; never self-certifies | after plan approval | inherit |
| `spec-reviewer` | requirement / business-rule / contract fidelity | core (non-trivial) | inherit |
| `test-reviewer` | missing tests, weak verification, edges, regressions | core (non-trivial); evidence-substitutable on low/medium risk (fast lane) | inherit |
| `code-reviewer` | local quality, maintainability, framework use, efficiency | non-trivial code | inherit |
| `security-reviewer` | auth/authz, input handling, secrets, trust boundaries | security-relevant risk | **opus** |
| `architecture-reviewer` | layering, boundaries, dependency direction, placement | structural concerns | inherit |
| `operability-reviewer` | observability, retries/timeouts, deploy, rollback | runtime/prod impact | inherit |
| `ui-ux-reviewer` | usability, interaction, layout, states, accessibility; consistency vs `design.md` when present | UI impact | inherit |
| `gatekeeper` | aggregates, re-rates by impact, decides readiness | after reviewers finish | **opus** |

- **Reviewers hold no editor tools** — `Read` / `Grep` / `Glob` / `Bash` for inspection; review-only behavior is enforced by policy and context isolation, not a hard read-only capability boundary (see [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md)). They propose the fix; the `implementer` applies it.
- **Correctness-critical paths receive ≥2 independent lenses** — parsing, numeric / encoding / overflow, concurrency, security, and data integrity — because the benchmark shows that a second reviewer reliably recovers defects the first rationalizes away.

## Examples and evidence

- [`examples/ready-run.md`](examples/ready-run.md) - real `READY` example extracted from `EVIDENCE.md`.
- [`examples/fix-required-run.md`](examples/fix-required-run.md) - real `FIX REQUIRED -> READY` repair-loop example extracted from `EVIDENCE.md`.
- [`examples/not-ready-run.md`](examples/not-ready-run.md) - illustrative `NOT READY` example, clearly marked as not evidence.
- [`examples/review-packet.md`](examples/review-packet.md), [`examples/final-report-compact.md`](examples/final-report-compact.md), and [`examples/final-report-full.md`](examples/final-report-full.md) show contract-field examples for reviewer input and delivery output; they are illustrative, not verbatim transcripts.

Real-world validation is tracked manually because udflow ships **no telemetry**. `EVIDENCE.md` is the source of truth:

| Track-2 metric | Current status |
|---|---|
| Type-B verified live runs | 12 / 10 |
| Distinct real projects | 2 / 3 |
| Non-maintainer runs | 0 / 1 |

Most valuable contribution: run udflow on real work and open a [Verified udflow run issue](https://github.com/kktu6507/universal-dev-flow-plugin/issues/new?template=verified-run.yml). Paste the `### Live run` block that udflow prints at the end. Keep misses, false alarms, cost, and follow-up outcome in the report; honest negatives are the point.

## Hooks and safety model

Six dependency-free Node hooks run in every enabled session. They are local-only, fail-open, and use only Node built-ins (`fs`, `os`, `path`, `crypto`).

| Hook | Event | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `plan-gate.js` | `PreToolUse` | Denies edit tools and obvious Bash/PowerShell writes while in plan mode. |
| `destructive-guard.js` | `PreToolUse` | Asks before narrow, unrecoverable destructive commands such as `rm -rf`, `git reset --hard`, `git push --force`, and PowerShell `Remove-Item -Recurse`. |
| `contract-guard.js` | `PreToolUse` | Asks before a Write/Edit/MultiEdit would remove/loosen a previously recorded contract acceptance criterion, `mustNotChange` entry, or scope path, downgrade `risk`, or wholesale-delete a `design.md` section. Watches `udflowOp/output/contract.md` plus the legacy `output/udflow/contract.md`. Also asks before a Write/Edit/MultiEdit to `.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/settings.local.json` would flip any of the four guard flags below from enabled to disabled in their effective, precedence-resolved value — including via a brand-new settings file. |
| `load-failure-memory.js` | `SessionStart` | Reads project `udflowOp/memory/FAILURE_MEMORY.md` (legacy `ai/FAILURE_MEMORY.md` as a read-only fallback), else global `~/.claude/FAILURE_MEMORY.md`, and injects a nonce-fenced, untrusted digest. |
| `compact-fidelity.js` | `SessionStart` · `compact` | Re-injects a concise workflow-continuity reminder after compaction. |
| `orchestration-check.js` | `Stop` | Advises when delivery claims contradict missing panel, blocking verdict, failed/unrun verification, or missing live-run evidence. |

Each hook that can prompt or restrict has a per-project opt-out — see [Configuration reference](#configuration-reference) below.

These hooks never delete files, change system settings, alter permissions, run subprocesses, download code, or transmit code/transcripts. They are guardrails, not a sandbox. See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) and [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md). Hooks also never migrate, write, or delete udflow's project files — the one-time legacy-layout migration is performed by the workflow itself, as visible tool actions in your session.

## Configuration reference

Everything below is optional. udflow's default behavior needs no configuration at all.

**Persistent settings** — `.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/settings.local.json` (local takes precedence), all under an `"udflow": { ... }` object. Each is **on by default**; set to `false` to opt out for that project:

| Key | Disables |
|---|---|
| `planGate` | `plan-gate.js` — the edit-block enforced while in plan mode |
| `destructiveGuard` | `destructive-guard.js` — the ask before narrow, unrecoverable destructive commands |
| `contractGuard` | `contract-guard.js` — the ask before a Write/Edit/MultiEdit would weaken `udflowOp/output/contract.md` (or the legacy `output/udflow/contract.md`) or delete a `design.md` section; also the ask before a Write/Edit/MultiEdit to `.claude/settings.json` / `.claude/settings.local.json` would turn any of these four guard flags off |
| `preserveOnCompact` | `compact-fidelity.js` — the post-compaction workflow-continuity reminder |

A malformed or unreadable settings file is treated as "not disabled" (fail-safe: the guard keeps running). Example — disable `contract-guard.js` for one project:

```json
// .claude/settings.json
{
  "udflow": { "contractGuard": false }
}
```

**Environment variables** — unset (empty) by default:

| Variable | Effect when set |
|---|---|
| `UDFLOW_ENFORCE_STOP` | any non-empty value makes the `orchestration-check.js` Stop hook hard-block delivery on a verdict/evidence mismatch, instead of only advising |
| `UDFLOW_HOOK_DEBUG` | `1` makes every hook append a one-line debug trace (used by [`/udflow:doctor`](#quick-start) and manual troubleshooting) |

```bash
# bash/zsh
UDFLOW_ENFORCE_STOP=1 claude
```

```powershell
# PowerShell
$env:UDFLOW_ENFORCE_STOP = "1"; claude
```

**Per-task capabilities** — off unless explicitly enabled for that task, never a hard dependency:

| Capability | How to enable |
|---|---|
| Codex cross-model second opinion | say so in the task (e.g. "use Codex if the repair loop gets stuck") — see [`references/external-capabilities.md`](udflow/skills/universal-dev-flow/references/external-capabilities.md) |
| MCP tools per reviewer | ships with an empty `.mcp.json`; add a server (see [`mcp.example.json`](udflow/mcp.example.json)) and uncomment the matching `mcp__*` line in that reviewer's frontmatter |

```text
/udflow:run Fix the login bug. Use Codex if the repair loop gets stuck.
```

**Per-run flags** — pass as arguments to `/udflow:run`:

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--deep` (or a `deep:` / `ultra:` prefix) | opts into deep-mode Tier 2: adversarial verification of findings + maximum reasoning effort for `gatekeeper`/`security-reviewer` — raises cost, never auto-engaged |
| `--no-deep` / `--shallow` | opts out of deep-mode Tier 1's deterministic panel enforcement, which otherwise auto-engages on high-risk/correctness-critical work |
| `--lite` | forces the smallest sufficient review panel and skips Tier 2, keeping a directly-relevant safety reviewer when a high-risk signal is present |
| `--report full` | the detailed end-of-run report (per-agent activity, full token/cost table) instead of the compact default |

```text
/udflow:run --deep Refactor the payment retry logic so a network timeout retries once with backoff.
/udflow:run --lite Fix the typo in the error message copy.
/udflow:run --report full Add rate limiting to the public API.
```

## Compatibility

udflow targets Claude Code. It also degrades under GitHub Copilot CLI where the plugin format loads but some Claude-Code-only hook outputs are not surfaced.

Compatibility and conformance smoke details live in [`docs/compatibility.md`](docs/compatibility.md). The short version:

- Claude Code is the primary runtime.
- GitHub Copilot CLI loads skills, subagents, and some PreToolUse decisions, but injected `SessionStart` and `Stop` output may be no-op.
- `destructive-guard.js` has been live-verified under Copilot CLI 1.0.65.
- Claude Code hook/agent contracts are moving targets; release smoke is recorded in [`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md).

## Trust and releases

udflow hooks auto-execute once the plugin is enabled, so install integrity matters.

Recommended safe install:

1. Install from a tagged release or pinned commit.
2. Review the shipped plugin's `hooks/` directory before enabling (repo path: `udflow/hooks/`).
3. Run `/udflow:doctor` after install.
4. Verify release tags with `git verify-tag vX.Y.Z` when a signed tag is available.
5. Verify release archives against their published `.sha256` files when assets are available.

See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for the trust model and [`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md) for release checklist, live smoke, signed tag setup, and checksum verification.

The quick-start marketplace command is a convenience path and follows the marketplace/repo state. Release checksums integrity-check the published archive; authenticity still depends on a signed tag or pinned SHA. They do not authenticate the default clone path, so use a tagged/SHA checkout or compare the verified archive against the installed `udflow/` tree when you need pinning.

## Cost

Typical real-app runs cost more than a one-shot AI review because udflow plans, verifies, reviews, and may repair. Order-of-magnitude guidance:

| Task | Reviewers | New tokens | Wall-clock |
|---|---|---|---|
| Light | `--lite`, core only | ~0.5-2M | a few minutes |
| Typical | 3-5 reviewers + one repair pass | ~2-7M | ~5-15 minutes |
| Deep | `--deep`, several repair loops | >10M | ~20-40 minutes |

The incident flow is cheap where it matters: wartime turns are short (one decision card at a time, no essays), the formal fix costs one normal udflow run (`--lite`), and `prepare` is a one-off repo scan.

Use `/udflow:run --lite` for cheaper runs, `--deep` for maximum scrutiny, and `--report full` when you need detailed per-agent activity and cost. An automatic **fast lane** goes one step further on small low/medium-risk changes: when execution evidence already answers the reviewer's question (every behavior-changing criterion has a red→green test and the full required suite is green), `test-reviewer` is evidence-substituted and disclosed via `udflow:panel=substituted:test-reviewer` — fewer agents on the same evidence, never on high-risk / deep runs.
